A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) program that creates conversational interaction between the chatbot and another user through voice commands or text chats.
What Is a Chatbot?
A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. Chatbot, short for chatterbot, is an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any major messaging application.
How chatbots work?
Historically, chatbots were text-based, and programmed to reply to a limited set of simple queries with answers that had been pre-written by the chatbot’s developers. They operated like an interactive FAQ, and while they worked well for those specific questions and answers on which they had been trained, they failed when presented with a complex question or one that hadn’t been predicted by the developers.
Why are chatbots important?
Organizations looking to increase sales or service productivity may adopt chatbots for time savings and efficiency, as artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots can converse with users and answer recurring questions As consumers move away from traditional forms of communication, many experts expect chat-based communication methods to rise. Organizations increasingly use chatbot-based virtual assistants to handle simple tasks, allowing human agents to focus on other responsibilities.
